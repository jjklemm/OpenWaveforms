# OpenWaveforms
Open-source visualization for radar altimetry waveforms

## Goals
The goal of this project is to create an open source desktop application that can be used to visualize radar altimetry waveforms. A prototype with some of the desired functionality has been created using the Bokeh library in Python. In order to accomplish all of the functionality that is desired for this application, the software will likely be migrated out of Bokeh and into a standalone application, likely in C++ with a GTK interface.
