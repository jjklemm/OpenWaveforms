# OpenWaveforms
Open-source visualization for radar altimetry waveforms

The goal of this project was to create an open source desktop application that can be used to visualize radar altimetry waveforms. A prototype with some of the desired functionality has been created using the Bokeh library in Python. This project is no longer under active development, feel free to check out the prototype.
